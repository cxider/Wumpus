        Our AI is named Fluke. Fluke has two general states: Discovery and Return. Fluke stores a grid that serves as its memory.
        Discovery mode is used when Fluke does not know where the gold is and Return mode will return to the start once the gold has been collected.
      </p>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Discovery mode searches for, and path-finds to, the nearest safe, undiscovered tile, updating the stored board as new tiles are uncovered.
        Inside of Discovery mode, if Fluke ever knows where the Wumpus is, it will kill the Wumpus.
      </p>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Return mode operates very similarly to Discovery mode. However, instead of path-finding to the nearest safe, undiscovered tile,
        Return mode searches for the shortest path back to the start, following a path of only tiles it has visited before.
      </p>

        Using this puzzle as an example. Fluke will start in Discovery mode and seek out the neighboring safe tiles.

        Here, Fluke detects a stench. Since it does not know which tile the Wumpus is on, it must backtrack.

      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Fluke has detected both a stench and a breeze, but using previous knowledge it knows that the tile above must be the Wumpus.
        It will kill the Wumpus and move up.

        After exploring Fluke has finally detected glitter. Knowing that the tile to the left is a pit and all other adjacent tiles having been explored,
        Fluke now knows the location of the gold.

        Robo Round Up
      </p>
      <p class = "log">
        Round 1<br><br>
        9 of 11 robots passed the first round. Fluke was able to succeed with no issue.
      </p>
      <p class = "log">
        Round 2<br><br>
        7 of 11 robots passed the first round. Fluke had no issues.
      </p>
      <p class = "log">
        Round 3<br><br>
        4 of 11 robots passed the first round. Fluke had no issues.
      </p>
      <p class = "log">
        Round 4<br><br>
        3 of 11 robots passed the first round. Fluke had no issues.
      </p>
      <p class = "log">
        Round 5<br><br>
        3 of 11 robots passed the first round. Fluke's first problem occured, the back tracking algorithm was slow causing the AI pause for a second.
        The issue was caused by trying to track backwards in an open area with only a few obstacles.
      </p>

        Ryan's Bonus Round<br><br>
        3 of 11 robots passed the first round. Fluke once again had no issues.
      </p>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Overall Fluke preformed well and was one of the three finalists. The main future improvement would be optimizing the slow backtracking algorithm.
      </p>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Other improvements would include; adding the ability to make statistical guesses when presented with an impossible board,
        and switching up how priotitized pathfinding works to be random in direction as it would take fewer steps on average.
