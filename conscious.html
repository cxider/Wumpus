      Is Fluke conscious?
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      Well the funny thing is we found it way easier to upload our brain into a computer, than to write an AI for Fluke.
      All joking aside Fluke is a relatively simple AI who is very specialized at what it can do.
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      Using a quote from the group presentations on what it means to have intelligence, "Intelligence can be defined as the ability to utilize one’s mind in order to perceive, comprehend, formulate,
      and execute solutions to problems and conflicts on both a minute or grand scale.
      While the brain gathers and stores knowledge, intelligence stems from the application
      or integration of said knowledge via the mind." - Peter Bitanga , Olivia Pisacano, Siddharth Shah
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      This would define intelligence as the integration of information to form a solution to a problem and act on it.
      Under that defintion Fluke is intelligent. However, we cannot just leave it at that;
      while Fluke is intelligent at hunting the Wumpus, it does not possess general intelligence.
      Fluke is only capable of hunting the Wumpus; If we changed the task, Fluke would not know what to do.
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      Fluke does have a mind under a similar definition as it is able reason and problem solve.
      However, the question of if Fluke is conscious is harder to answer. The issue is that conscious is hard to define.
      It is unlikely that Fluke has a consciousness, this is because Fluke is very limited in its ability to rationalize and think.
      Fluke is only able to reason and make observations about the game. We can use the mirror test to determine if a being has a concept of self and is conscious.
      In a mirror test, a subject is put under anesthetics and has some type of mark placed on it.
      The subject will then be shown its own reflection.
      The test is if a the subject will be able to recognize that its own reflection to remove the mark.
      Fluke would not pass this test and would in fact be incapable of even taking this test to determine consciousness.
    </p>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      To summarize, Fluke is intelligent but only in a very narrow scope. The AI lacks any of the higher level of reasoning needed for a consciousness.
      However, this does not change our opinion on the feasibility of true AI. This is because trying to compare Fluke to even our current day AIs
      is unfair. A modern day AI like IBM Waston is exponentally more powerful and complex compared to Fluke.
