        Hunt the Wumpus
      </p>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Wumpus World, origially known as Hunt the Wumpus is a mindsweeper-like
        puzzle game where a player tries to navigate a hazardous cave while trying to escape with the gold.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/archer_intro.png">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        You are a hunter who has entered the cave of the Wumpus. You start in the bottom left. You are able to move up, down, left, or right. You cannot move in diagonals.
        In addition to being able to move you can also sense your surroundings; however, you are not able to see the hazards on the map.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/gold_intro.png">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        As a hunter, your task is to escape with the gold. To do this we will introduce you to your first sense, glitter.
        Glitter appears whenever you move into a tile that is adjacent to a gold.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/glitter_intro.png">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        By sensing glitter and moving around we can discover the location of the gold tile.
        Once we have found out where the gold is we can pick it up and try to escape.
        However the puzzle is not that easy. The cave is a dangerous place filled with hazards.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/pit_intro.png">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        The first obstacle we will introduce is the pit. If you ever walk over a pit you will fall to your death.
        In order to avoid pits we will use a new sense, breeze. Whenever you are close to a pit you will feel a breeze.
        The only problem is we don't know how many pits exist and we must be cautious of tiles where we can feel a breeze near.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/breeze_intro.png">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        However, pits are not the only thing to look out for in the cave. We must also avoid the Wumpus.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/wumpus_intro.png">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Similar to the other obstacle we have encountered, we also know a way to detect the Wumpus, stench.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/stench_intro.png">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        However as a hunter, we have a way to fight againts the Wumpus. If we can figure out where the Wupus is we have one arrow.
        We can fire the arrow in a direction, if the Wumpus was in an adjacent tile and in that direction,
        we will shoot the Wumpus killing it. This will cause its stench to disapear and allow us to travel through that tile.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/puzzle1.png" style="width: 400px">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Here is an example of a puzzle where we would have to kill the Wumpus. By just walking in safe tiles we will get this board.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/puzzle1-2.png" style="width: 400px">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        We will then step into the middle tile and shoot the arrow to the right as it is the only direction the Wumpus could be.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/puzzle1-3.png" style="width: 400px">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        Now when we step to the right we will sense a gold and a breeze.
        We know the locations of two pits; one is above us and the other is below.
        This does not tell us that the tile to the right is safe. However, we also sensed glitter.
        Since the tile to the right is the only neighboring tile that could contain gold, it must be safe.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <img src="images/puzzle1-4.png" style="width: 400px">
      </div>
      <p class = "paragraph">
        After finding the gold, we can just retrace our steps back to the begining of the cave and escape.
